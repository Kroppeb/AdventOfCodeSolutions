* OMFG, awesome start
* [x] add max(n) and all related functions

## Day 02
59/12; points: 131, 5th place
* WHU??
* Hardcoded stuff, seems like I wasn't the only one
* Lost quite some time rereading stuff
* [x] maybe add a `mod` infix function to do mod stuff?

## Day 03
39/21; points: 142, 4th place
* ????
* Lost a bunch of time checking assumptions I made by reading the problem text
* [x] `splitIn`
* [x] `Iterable<Set<T>>.union` and `intersect`

## Day 04
27/15; points: 160, 5th place
* separated by minus signs => use posInts()

note: I want to add these helpers
* [x] HetN for n in 2-9
* [x] DFS

## Day 05
64/73; points: 65, 4th place
* input parsing took long
* Don't know why I went with Deques  

## Day 06
114/108; points: 0, 15th place
* lost a lot of time trying to understand which value to return
* also `firstIndexOf` indeed existed, should have trusted myself
* nim-ka has some interesting utils I should steal
  * [x] rotate left and right


note: I want to add thes helpers
* [ ] Line3D (maybe LineG?)
* [ ] maybe Bounds3D? (already have BoundsG)
* [x] splitAt
* [ ] grid.findPoints / findSinglePoint (throws if multiple match) 
  * update y17d22
* [x] pure state loop
  * update y18d18 and others (look for maps)
* [x] allMaxByKey/value
