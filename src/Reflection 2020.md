# Reflection

## Day 1
* servers went down, no points
* [ ] get tool to download input for me
    eh, curl is working fine
* [x] ~~fix getting input in main module~~ remember where the input file is supposed to go

## Day 2
* [x] Missing `Lines` type
* [x] getLines doesn't remove final empty line. That only happens in the `grid` function

## Day 3
* [x] Add the ability to do Int % IntRange and Point % Bounds 

## Day 4
- Today was just data parsing. Wasn't really fun.

## Day 6
- It's called `.reduce` FYI, don't forget
* [x] `.splitOn{}`. Should have done this 2 days ago honestly.

## Day 7
* [ ] `.log` short for `.also{println(it)}`
* [ ] `mmof<>()` short for `mutableMapOf<>()` and family
* [ ] `cached` kinda like pythons `@lru_cache`
