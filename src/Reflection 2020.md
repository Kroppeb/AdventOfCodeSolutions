# Reflection

## Day 1
* servers went down, no points
* [ ] get tool to download input for me
    eh, curl is working fine
* [x] ~~fix getting input in main module~~ remember where the input file is supposed to go

## Day 2
* [x] Missing `Lines` type
* [x] getLines doesn't remove final empty line. That only happens in the `grid` function

## Day 3
* [x] Add the ability to do Int % IntRange and Point % Bounds
