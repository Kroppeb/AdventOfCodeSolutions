# Reflection

## Day 1
* Just a bit rusty on kotlin it seems

## Day 2
Intellij managed to hurt a lot today. Although after checking the recording
it seems I wouldn't have gotten any points anyway. However, stuff like this
needs to be avoided in the future. My assumption is that Intellij didn't
notice the file had been changed.
* [ ] Create download script.
  * [ ] Download the file
  * [ ] Force copy it to the `out` folder to bypass IntelliJ
  * [ ] Make it run automatically, or delay until after 6:00:01 am 
    so that I don't have to alt tab to bash to run it 
* [ ] The current way of io and stuff hurts Copilot, look into a better
  way of io.

## Day 3
Intellij managed to hurt a lot today again, due to the input files of last 
year still being in the output directory. They have been cleared
* Should've used `getDigitLines()` instead of `getLines()`
* [ ] make checklist for things to do before the contest

## Day 4
YYYEEEEEESSS, Got some point (19) =p 
* Accidentally opened the question in a new tab, caused me some issues
* So I knew I had a `getInts` function, but it was not working.

## Day 5
Points (59), 184th place
* [ ] add `getPoint` like `getInts`?
* [ ] add short `splitOnEmpty`
* [x] add short form for creating sets and maps
* [ ] add short for `first()` and `last()`
* [ ] add `Line` (and `SteppedLine`) class which is iterable

## Day 6
Points (76), 122nd place
* shorts for IntArray/LongArray?
