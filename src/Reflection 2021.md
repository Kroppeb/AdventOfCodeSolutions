# Reflection

## Day 01
* Just a bit rusty on kotlin it seems

## Day 02
Intellij managed to hurt a lot today. Although after checking the recording
it seems I wouldn't have gotten any points anyway. However, stuff like this
needs to be avoided in the future. My assumption is that Intellij didn't
notice the file had been changed.
* [ ] Create download script.
  * [ ] Download the file
  * [ ] Force copy it to the `out` folder to bypass IntelliJ
  * [ ] Make it run automatically, or delay until after 6:00:01 am 
    so that I don't have to alt tab to bash to run it 
* [ ] The current way of io and stuff hurts Copilot, look into a better
  way of io.

## Day 03
Intellij managed to hurt a lot today again, due to the input files of last 
year still being in the output directory. They have been cleared
* Should've used `getDigitLines()` instead of `getLines()`
* [ ] make checklist for things to do before the contest

## Day 04
YYYEEEEEESSS, Got some point (19) =p 
* Accidentally opened the question in a new tab, caused me some issues
* So I knew I had a `getInts` function, but it was not working.

## Day 05
59 points, 184th place
* [ ] add `getPoint` like `getInts`?
* [ ] add short `splitOnEmpty`
* [x] add short form for creating sets and maps
* [ ] add short for `first()` and `last()`
* [ ] add `Line` (and `SteppedLine`) class which is iterable

## Day 06
76 points, 122nd place
* shorts for IntArray/LongArray?

## Day 07
22 points, 118th place
* The used theme was hiding the root cause of a compiler error

## Day 08
no points, 127th place
* Had some trouble understanding the input
* Forgot 0 existed

## Day 09
no points, 140th place
* If I had realised that I could pad the sides with 9 or 10 sooner,
it would've been much faster to solve the problem.
* [ ] grids
* [ ] maybe add 2d filter for a grid, including a partial centered one
* [ ] multidimensional `toMutable` lists etc
* [ ] `implies` 
* [ ] shortcut to enable/disable copilot
* for part 2, a repeat(1000) would have been enough, and less error prone

## Day 10
no points, 153rd place
* lol bracketstack
* should've copied the points table into a comment before making the points map
* Oh, I really wish we had for else loops in kotlin

## Day 11
no points, 162nd place
* [ ] look into grids again
* [ ] `mapSelf` to mutate a map in place (and multidimensional)

## Day 12
no points, 168th place
* didn't save the parsed data immediately
* [ ] graphs, eg from adjancency list
  * path type
* [ ] short type names for mutable types

## Day 13
no points, 181st place
* Should have worked on the coordinates instead of an actual grid

## Day 14
* [ ] add `splitOnEmpty`, short for `splitOn{it.isEmpty()}`
* check the **full** checklist before the day
* Thinking that all I had to do was switch from ints to longs was dumb as
  you can never need to have a long for the count of items in a list, cause
  that would imply you had an oom error.


## Day 15
* Look into the current path stuff/add quick and easy path helpers

## Day 16

## Day 18
WTF
