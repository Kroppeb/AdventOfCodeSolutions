# Old unfinished tasks
* [ ] Graphs
* [ ] Add associateIndex
* [ ] getPermutations
* [ ] quick input naming
* [ ] List.printLines maybe? errr .map{println(it)} is quite good
* [ ] Grids
* [ ] directional points
* [x] list of points to Bounds
    `.entitygrid().bounds`
* [x] Bound iteration
* [ ] text printer
* [ ] mod int (used for dirs) (how will this be used?)
* [x] `Clock()`
* [ ] better display for grids?
* [ ] maybe even more clock functionality
    * [ ] a way to convert from point to neighbour id and back // what? 
* [ ] list of char/char array to string is hard
* [ ] Maze simplifiers
* [ ] Path algos
    * [ ] DFS
    * [ ] BFS
    * [ ] Dijkstra
    * [ ] A*
    * [ ] Searching (intcomputer walking around)
    * [ ] A* with weak heuristic. (doesn't require it to be a lower bound, so don't stop when route is found)
* So IntelliJ just removed y trailing spaces, which were kinda needed. lost 5 minutes and 17 points due to that. Something to remember for next time
* [ ] Some fancy lists
    * [ ] cyclic list
    * [ ] bi list (list for pos and neg indexes)
    * [ ] py list? (wrapper? that allows neg index to count from back, like cyclic)
    * [ ] default list
* [ ] Grids
    * [ ] a lot of freedom wanted yet many quick build-ins. Maybe builder?
    * [ ] (quad)grid
    * [ ] door grid
    * [ ] gated-grid = grid + doors
    * [ ] hex-grid
    * [ ] triangle grid
    * [ ] Path calculation
    * [ ] closest, furthest
    * [ ] 3d grids?
    * [ ] sum query?
        * [ ] max query
        * [ ] binOp query
* [ ] Graphs (and grids are graphs)
* [ ] BracketStack
* [ ] (stepped) Toposort
* [ ] eventqueue 
* [ ] ticking game system // for turnbased combat or similar
* [ ] add a lot of `...Indexed()`
* [ ] sequences
